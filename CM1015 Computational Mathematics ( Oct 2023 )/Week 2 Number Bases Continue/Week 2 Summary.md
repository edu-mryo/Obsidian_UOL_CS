- Non integer number conversion is not much different from integer number only with slight additional calculation for anything after fraction

eg: I want to convert 17.375 into binary 
1. Proceed with the standard conversion for integers before fraction
2. For fractional point, use the $a^-1$ , $a^-2$... for conversion

```
1 x 10^1 + 7 x 10^0 + 3 x 10^-1 + 7 x 10^-2 + 5 x 10^-3

= 10 + io7

```
