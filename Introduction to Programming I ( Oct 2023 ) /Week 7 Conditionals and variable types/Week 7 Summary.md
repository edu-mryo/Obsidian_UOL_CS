### What is Conditional Statements ?
A statement which will trigger / execute additional code only if a certain requirement is triggered 

Pseudo Code Example
-  `If there are no eggs in my fridge, get some`
	- The action is triggered only when you don't have any egg in the fridge. 

- `If tommorow is Monday, go to the gym in the morning. If tomorrow is Tuesday, then go to the gym in the afternoon`
	- The logic provides alternative action if it does not meet the first condition.

- `If my Phone battery is below 10%, charge it for 30 minutes. If it is between 11% to 50%, then charge it for 10 minutes. For anything else, don't charge my phone.`
	- The logic provides safety-net logic which gets triggered if the condition did not meet any requirement.  In this case, if the phone has 60% of battery left, then the safety-net condition will get triggered .
