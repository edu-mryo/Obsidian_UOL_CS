### The art of asking for help
- Coding is complex and the surrounding technologies rapidly evolve, which means ***we are constantly in learning mode***. It is really normal for programmers, developers and engineers to ***"not know everything"*** ( If you think engineers memorise everything, then that's too naive mindset.) You need to be aware of "knowing what you don't know." and being able to ask the appropriate question to solve your issues.
- The world of information technology is usually **open sourced**. Most of the answers are documented and there are many communities and forums you can use to ask question and communicate. Use these tools and platforms to find answers or ask effective questions
	- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) 
### Poor and Good questions
- There are poor and good questions. Most people will gradually learn how to ask effective questions, but it is still important to focus on below points
	- Poor questions often miss details and vague. 
		> **"My program is not working. How can I fix this?"**

		--> What exactly is the issue ? What program ? How does it not work ? 
	- Good questions are detail oriented ( but not too much ) and clear with purpose of question
		>**"My Python code which intends to scrape website and return summary by using LLM is returning an error which I am not aware of. The error cod is xxx and I have checked the document which did not mention such an error. I use xxx and version is xxx. I have also attached the script."**
