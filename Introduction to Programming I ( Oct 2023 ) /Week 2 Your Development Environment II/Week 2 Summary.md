### Philosophy of Coding
- Coding is hard. Don't think it's easy like how it is often depicted in the media
- To be in the **Flow** 
	- a psychological concept in which you feel intensely focused on the present. You feel mastery over your actions and you experienced the shortening of time.
	- You feel intrinsically rewarded by what you're doing and coders do the same.

"The work making software gave me a little jolt of joy each time a piece of code worked. When something wasn't working the world fell away. My body vanished and time receded.
Three or five hours later, when the piece of the problem came together and clicked into a solution, I served a swelling wave of endorphins."
